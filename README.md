# Queued4Lunch
Another School project. My code is the lunch.cpp file

Description:
This is supposed to find you a path from one "room" to another "room" by going through only adjacent doors.
Input will be like this:
X Y            <=== X = number of rooms, Y = number of doors
W Z            <=== W = starting room, Z = room we want to end in
* *           <==== Then Y number of lines with numbers from 1<X.
